Animashaun Tosin Damilare is a Software Engineering student at NIIT in Nigeria, his country of origin. He is a programming enthusiast who has to his credits knowledge in HTML4, CSS3 as well as the Java programming language. He also has some basic knowledge of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Python, Javascript, and PHP and quite a number of programming concepts.

Ace Takwas as he's fondly called by friends, is a God-fearing lover of technology. He is a fairly skilled IT personnel with great potentials as well as high prospects.

His nickname Takwas is a name he got from college as a result of his involvement in the TaeKwanDo sport for a short period of time

Tosin has been a long time admirer of the geek culture; he loves things that are nerdy, geeky or just connected with intellectualism.

He started-off as a geek-wannabe, and through a defiant spirit came to establish the fact that he is a born-g33k. His latest test results from the Inner-Geek website show that He’s a Total G33K.

His other interests are English (he’s an Anglophile!), Reading, and Music (Christian Music & Gospel Rap).


What Have I learnt?

Well, so far I have been introduced to quite an array of interesting concepts such as IRC Communication, GitHub, Vim, RST (which I'm currently working on) amongst others.
